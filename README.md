#### Description:
Prototype Program using java.awt Frame and Window to create an "AutoPlayer" for volleyball videos.
The intended purpose of the program is to strip the most recently posted videos from the given channels in the program (currently NCAA Championships, Out of System, and AVP Beach Volleyball). The user then has options to play the videos, resort, clear, and remove videos from the playlist.

#### current TODO:
- make it more user friendly and visually attractive
- be able to resort by date videos were posted
- be able to swap videos in the playlist queue
